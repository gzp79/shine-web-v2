# Generated static content folder

This is a similar folder to the `static` folder, but content is copied selectively based on the environment and config options:
 - `mockServiceWorker.js` - Service worker generated by the msw mocking tool
 - `assets` - During local run the assets are generated here to reduce external dependencies
